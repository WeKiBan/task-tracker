Build a production-ready React + Tailwind web app called “Dev Status”.

This is a personal, local-only Jira companion used all day to track active work and generate a daily status email.

All data must persist in localStorage.

No backend. No authentication.

📌 Core Concept

The app is a minimalist working-memory tool for a developer.

It is:

Fast

Clean

Drag-based priority

Used all day

Generates a plain-text email summary at end of day
